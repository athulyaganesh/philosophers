# Creative Design Thinking Problems on Distributed Operating Systems

## Description

This assignment focuses on creative design thinking problems related to distributed operating systems. It involves implementing solutions to various challenges using concepts such as POSIX threads, mutex locks, semaphores, and Lamportâ€™s Vector Logical Clock.

## Topics Covered

- Operating Systems Fundamentals
- Programming
- POSIX Threads
- Process Scheduling
- Process Synchronization
- Distributed Clocks
- Shared Memory
- Deadlocks
- Starvation
- Software Testing
